# Varian solution

The solutions has 3 projects:
  - Varian.BusinessLogic -> Class Library Project with the logic for this component.
  - Varian.ConsoleApp -> Console Application Project. Can be used to test the new component.
  - Varian.UnitTest -> Unit Test project with some test cases.
  
Requirements:
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
  - .Net Framework 4.6
  
Instrutions:
  - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
  - Run Varian.ConsoleApp to test it. In this test you will use the command line to enter the input.
  - Run All Tests to run the tests implemented in Varian.UnitTest.
 
 
 My questions about the requirements:
  - In the problem description you said "a new component is required". But in the task you said "Implement a service". So Did I need to implement a webservice (WCF, WebAPI)? If yes I can still do it.
  - It will scan only the number that are whole word. Example: Wpa81 is the username with id 16. 81 would not match to be replaced.
  
 Let me know if you have any question about the solutions.
 Thank you.
